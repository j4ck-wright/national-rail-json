# ðŸš‚ National Rail JSON API

A RESTful JSON API acting as a proxy to National Rail's LDBWS (Live Departure Board Web Service) written using NodeJS & TypeScript

The underlying API (Darwin) uses a [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) protocol and can be perticulaly tricky when using on a frontend application.

This app is built specifically to use [OpenLDBWS/ldb11](https://lite.realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWS/ldb11.asmx)

## What is LDBWS?

From [their documentation](https://lite.realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWS/):
> LDBWS provides a request-response web service to access real time train information from Darwin. This is the same information that powers the Live Departure Boards, provided in XML format.
## Features

This application acts as a modern JSON wrapper around LDBWS, providing:

- **XML to JSON conversion**
- **RESTful API**
- **Real-time Darin data**
- **Filtering options**

## API Endpoints
Swagger documentation is available at the root of the app. The currently supported routes are:

```bash
GET /arrivals/:crs
GET /arrivals/:crs/detailed
GET /departures/:crs
GET /departures/:crs/detailed
GET /arrivals-and-departures/:crs
GET /arrivals-and-departures/:crs/detailed
GET /service:serviceId
```

## Example Usage

```bash
# Get departures from Leeds showing the next 10 services
curl "http://localhost:3000/departures/LDS?numRows=10"

# Get arrivals at Bradford Interchange from Leeds
curl "http://localhost:3000/arrivals/BDI?filterCrs=LDS&filterType=from"
```
