# ðŸš‚ National Rail JSON API

A RESTful JSON API acting as a proxy to National Rail's LDBWS (Live Departure Board Web Service) written using NodeJS & TypeScript.

The underlying API (Darwin) uses a [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) protocol and can be perticulaly tricky when using on a frontend application. Darwin provides the Industryâ€™s official designated real-time customer timetable. All of the franchised GB Train Operating Companies supply Darwin with information about when they expect their trains to arrive and depart any given station.

This app is built specifically to use [OpenLDBWS/ldb11](https://lite.realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWS/ldb11.asmx)

For consumers using this, I would recommend reading [National Rail Enquiries' Developer Guidelines](https://assets.nationalrail.co.uk/e8xgegruud3g/7yPy7gHJ7j3QZalp2zKZKJ/e32e5b871465c3a5f920e86cc07900d6/Developer_Guidelines_v_05-01.pdf) to see if this fits your use case.

## What is LDBWS?

From [their documentation](https://lite.realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWS/):
> LDBWS provides a request-response web service to access real time train information from Darwin. This is the same information that powers the Live Departure Boards, provided in XML format.

## API Endpoints
Swagger documentation is available at the root of the app. The currently supported routes are:

```bash
GET /arrivals/:crs
GET /arrivals/:crs/detailed
GET /departures/:crs
GET /departures/:crs/detailed
GET /departures/:crs/next
GET /arrivals-and-departures/:crs
GET /arrivals-and-departures/:crs/detailed
GET /service/:serviceId
```

## Example Usage

```bash
# Get departures from Leeds showing the next 10 services
curl "http://localhost:3000/departures/LDS?numRows=10"

# Get arrivals at Bradford Interchange from Leeds
curl "http://localhost:3000/arrivals/BDI?filterCrs=LDS&filterType=from"

# Get service details about an existing train (obtained via a ServiceBoard)
curl "http://localhost:3000/service/1266343LEEDS___"

# Get next departing train from Leeds to Doncaster or London
curl "http://localhost:3000/departures/LDS/next?destinationCrs=DON&destinationCrs=KGX
```
